# Udacity Advanced Data Analysis: We Rate Dogs Twitter Archive Data Wrangling Project

In this project, I wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because:

WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
